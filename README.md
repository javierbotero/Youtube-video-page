# Project: Embedding Images and Video

## About

This is our first HTML/CSS project on the Microverse course. The aim of the project is to make a clone of a previous version of youtube. To that end, we were provided with an archive link to use as a reference.

Over the course of the project we achieved a solid understanding on html elements, and specially layout design. 
Experimenting with different HTML attributes and CSS properties we have improved our skills in finely tuning the look of the site.
